    This small project is the demo of a mini GUI and underlying functions that fetches prices on financial assets, calculate different metrics, returns and plot the returns of a portfolio composed of these assets. 
    <br>
    Additionally the tool performs basic statistical analysis of financial and non-financial data, applies different clustering algorythms, conducts Prinicipal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis to get a better understanding of certain underyling characteristics.
    <br>
    Amongst others the small tool performs the following steps:
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>Fetching data from Yahoofinance and other sources</li>
    <li>Clean and format the data and create return time series </li>
    <li>Calculate different metrics on the time series</li>
    <li>Create portfolios and plot their performance across time with Plotly</li>
    Moreover

    <li>Performs KMeans and MiniBatch clustering and Prinicipal Component Analysis on the underlying dataset </li>
    </ul>
